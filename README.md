# AngularTourOfHeroes The Hero Editor

created a new component
added the component to main component so it is displayed
used ngModel for data binding. ngModel is an Angular directive

AppModule stores the metadata that fits the different pieces of our application together
In app module we import shit we need like FormsModule where the ngModel directive lives.
Components must be added to AppModule.
